## Explanation of the design decisions

#### Astro as static site generator

Used Astro because its a lot faster to setup, it allows me to just start prototyping without thinking about framework constraints. When I need to have a feature that requires a framework, I can just add it in. Also I can mix and match different frameworks if I want to. For example, there is a library that I want to use that is only available in React, I can just add React to the project and use it.

#### Tailwind CSS

Used TailwindCSS instead of hardcoding CSS because it is a lot faster to prototype with. I can just add classes to the HTML and see the changes immediately. Also, it is a lot easier to maintain because I can see all the styles that are being used in the HTML file. Also I don't miss the traditional CSS because I can still use it if I want to.
